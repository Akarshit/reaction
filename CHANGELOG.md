# v3.0.0

We're excited to introduce version 3.0.0 (v3.0.0) of the Reaction Commerce GraphQL API (hereby referred to as "The Reaction API"). In this version, we've expanded the existing GraphQL API to include administrative and operator functionality, eliminated the Meteor framework from the Reaction API, split the Reaction Admin UI and the identity provider into separate services, added support for plugins as NPM packages, and improved automated integration testing for the Reaction API.

## Notable Changes

### Reaction API is now fully headless

The [reactioncommerce/reaction](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/tree/v3.0.0) repo exclusively hosts the Reaction API in v3.0.0. This Reaction API now has full GraphQL coverage of the functionality that was previously provided by Meteor. In v2 we introduced GraphQL into the Reaction API for storefronts. Now the Reaction API includes GraphQL coverage for administrative and operator functionality. This enables the creation of custom UI for operating a shop using Reaction Commerce.

### Plugins as NPM Packages

The Reaction API plugin system has changed a lot - primarily because the Reaction API runs as a Node.js application instead of a Meteor application. It's now possible and recommended to write plugins as NPM packages. See our docs on [plugins in Reaction 3.x](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/next/devs-update-custom-plugin) for details.

### Permissions system overhaul

Permissions of a Reaction Account are now exclusively determined by the permissions of the Group (or Groups) the Account belongs to.

Previously, roles (renamed permissions) were attached to a user by querying the single Group a user belonged to, and copying the group permissions over to the user account. Permissions were then checked against the user.roles object. If there was ever an update to the permissions a group was allowed, every user in the group needed to be updated.

In v3.0.0, Accounts are now allowed to be added to more than one group, and permissions are checked by querying the Groups the user belongs too, aggregating all permissions all of these groups, and then checking against this list of permissions. If a group is ever updated, each individual account no longer needs to be updated.

### Improved Integration Test Coverage

We've written many integration tests for our Reaction API. See this [GitHub ticket](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/5310) for a full list of new integration tests. While we've made huge strides here to improve test coverage, there is still room for improvement here. We'd welcome contributions that improve our test coverage!

### Removed Meteor from the Reaction API

Improving developer experience has been high on the list of priorities for quite a while.  We've made significant improvements to startup, restart, and build times for the `reaction` project by removing Meteor. In doing this we've also updated to [version 12 of Node.js, which is in *Active LTS* status](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).

### Reaction Admin has a new home

With this release, we are also introducing a beta of [Reaction Admin](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-admin), now a standalone application. We've moved the codebase for the Admin UI into a separate repository - [reactioncommerce/reaction-admin](http://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-admin/tree/v3.0.0-beta).
It's important to note that while this is the official v3.0.0 release of the Reaction API, we're keeping the `beta` tag on Reaction Admin for now.

Our focus and effort for this release has primarily been on readying our full GraphQL Reaction API. We're keeping Reaction Admin in beta because it uses Meteor under the hood for builds and there are still a few Meteor APIs left in the codebase. The future Reaction Admin UI will use the Reaction API exclusively.
The Reaction Admin project will be in beta beyond the v3.0.0 release of Reaction API. We suggest careful consideration before copying any patterns found in the Reaction Admin project while it still has the beta tag. There are sections where it consumes the Reaction API and other sections that still use patterns from when the Admin UI was part of the monolithic Meteor application.

### New identity provider service: Reaction Identity

This release moves the identity provider for Reaction into a separate service  - [reactioncommerce/reaction-identity](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-identity). Reaction Identity is the user interface and server for identity management, including user registration, login, logout, and password change. It works together with [reaction-hydra](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-hydra) to enable OAuth2 flows.

### Independent Releases

v3.0.0 is a coordinated release across all of Reaction's open source projects. Following this release, we will release Reaction Commerce projects independently. For example, if there are fixes or improvements made to the Example Storefront or to the API, they can be released without bumping the version of every other project. Reaction Development Platform will continue to be bumped with each release of a Reaction Commerce project.

### Mongo 4

Mongo version 4.0+ is now required. [Mongo 4 introduces multi-document transactions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/transactions/). Requiring Mongo 4+ means that services and plugins can start using transactions where necessary to ensure better data integrity.

### Default to running public docker images

The docker-compose.yml file in each project now uses public images rather than building an image. This drastically speeds up the initial startup time in development, and makes the application run smoother in development. When you're ready to start developing, you'll need to switch over to using the docker-compose.dev.yml file in the project you're wanting to develop - see for example:  [reaction/docker-compose.dev.yml](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/blob/v3.0.0/docker-compose.dev.yml)).

### Migrations

The migration tool in Reaction v2.x depended on Meteor and was built into the Reaction monolith. For v3.0.0, we've moved to a new CLI migration tool for MongoDB. We weren't planning to write Migrator, but we couldn't find anything that met all of our MongoDB migration needs. Although we built [Migrator](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/migrator) for Reaction Commerce, it is a general purpose MongoDB data migration tool that you can use for any project. See the [project page](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/migrator) for details on why we decided to build our own and to learn how to use the new migration tool.
We've got an [example project](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/api-migrations) that you can use to get started. There's also an [npm package](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/db-version-check) that can ensure your database has migrated to the correct version before running any commands.

### How to get started with Reaction v3.0.0

Our (recently renamed) [reactioncommerce/reaction-development-platform](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-development-platform/tree/v3.0.0) project is still the best place to start if you want to check out what Reaction has to offer or start developing for Reaction.
If you're experienced with Reaction already check-out our [Upgrade Guide](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/next/upgrading). If you've got a plugin you'd like to upgrade, read our guide for [updating a 2.x API plugin to work with Reaction API 3.x](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/next/devs-update-custom-plugin).

# v2.9.0

Reaction v2.9.0 adds integration tests for GraphQL API endpoints, security updates and fixes a fulfillment method bug.

This release is being coordinated with [Reaction Platform](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-platform) and is designed to work with `v2.9.0` of [Reaction Hydra](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-hydra) and [Example Storefront](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/example-storefront).

## Notable changes

### Add integration tests and increase `maxWorkers`

As a part of the major push to remove the Meteor dependency from the GraphQL API, we've been adding more Jest integration tests with the goal of full integration test coverage for all GraphQL queries and mutations provided by all core and included plugins. In this release, we've added tests for the following GraphQL queries: `shopBySlug`, `orderByReferenceId`, `ordersByAccountId`, `addTag` and `removeTag`. See test coverage epic [here](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/5310).

### Fix a fulfillment bug

Refactors the `updateOrderFulfillmentGroup` GraphQL mutation to update only the specified group, not all fulfillment groups.

### Update packages for security vulnerabilities

Bumps [@reactioncommerce/data-factory](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/data-factory/) to version 1.0.1 and [@reactioncommerce/job-queue](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-job-queue) to version 1.0.5.


## Tests
- Add integration tests for shopBySlug GraphQL query [#5701](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5701)
- Add integration tests for orderByReferenceId GraphQL query [#5697](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5697)

# v2.8.1
Reaction v2.8.1 adds a bug fix and contains no breaking changes since v2.8.0

This release is being coordinated with `reaction-platform` and is designed to work with `v2.8.1` of `example-storefront` and `reaction-hydra`.

## Notable changes

### Fix password reset issue

Password reset has been fixed to correctly send a password reset email, and re-direct the user once their new password has been set.

## Fixes

fix: password-reset route not working correctly ([#5744](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5744))

# v2.8.0

Reaction v2.8.0 adds performance enhancements and fixes bugs.

# v2.4.0

Reaction v2.4.0 adds minor features and performance enhancements, fixes bugs and contains no breaking changes since v2.3.0.

This release is being coordinated with [Reaction Platform](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-platform) and is designed to work with `v2.4.0` of [Reaction Hydra](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-hydra) and [Example Storefront](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/example-storefront).

## Notable changes

### Translations have been moved out of Meteor

i18n translations have been moved outside of the Meteor context. This provides a standard route, `/locales/resources.json`, where all translations live, and allows for real-time updates to translations without needing to flush the cache.

### Meteor app-tests have

As part of our move away from Meteor, all Meteor app-tests have been removed. This speeds up both local testing, and testing on CI.

## Feature

- feat: Translations without Meteor ([#5514](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5514))

## Fixes

- fix: restore Add/Remove menu item in products page ([#5564](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5564))

# v2.3.0

Reaction v2.3.0 adds minor features and performance enhancements, fixes bugs and contains no breaking changes since v2.2.1.

This release is being coordinated with `reaction-platform` and is designed to work with `v2.3.0` of `example-storefront` and `reaction-hydra`.

## Notable changes

### Bulk add and remove Tags from Products

Reaction Admin users can now add and remove tags from products in bulk. After selecting multiple products in the product table or filtering products with a CSV file, users can specify tags they'd like to add or remove from those products.

This feature uses several new components from the [**Catalyst Design System**](https://catalyst.reactioncommerce.com/), including [**SplitButton**](https://catalyst.reactioncommerce.com/#/Components/Actions/SplitButton), [**Chip**](https://catalyst.reactioncommerce.com/#/Components/Content/Chip) and [**MultiSelect**](https://catalyst.reactioncommerce.com/#/Components/Inputs/Select). Several dependencies, including [`react-select`](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select), [`react-dropzone`](https://github.com/react-dropzone/react-dropzone) and [`material-ui/core`](https://material-ui.com/) were upgraded to their latest versions.

### Image uploading without Meteor

`file-collections` has been updated to its latest version, which supports uploading without Meteor. All related code has been updated to remove Meteor.

### Remove `context.callMeteorMethod`

All GraphQL mutations which still used Meteor methods via the `context.callMeteorMethod` function - `inviteShopMember`, `addressBookRemove`, `removeAccountFromGroup`, `setAccountProfileCurrency`, `updateAccountAddressBookEntry` -  have been updated to fully use GraphQL. In turn `context.callMeteorMethod` is no longer used, and has been removed from the codebase.

## Feature

- feat: manage product tags in bulk ([#5485](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5485))
- feat: Add Orders GraphQL query ([#5483](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5483))
- feat: Image uploading without Meteor ([#5515](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5515))

## Fixes

- fix: info inline alert should autoclose ([#5502](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5502))
- fix: Perform old password validation ([#5527](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5527))

## Refactors

- refactor: use moments calendar format to display time alongside date ([#5523](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5523))
- refactor: remove context.callMeteorMethod ([#5524](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5524))

- refactor: rewrite updateAccountAddressBookEntry to not call through to Meteor method ([#5484](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5484))

## Tests

- tests: Add Integration Test for orderById GraphQL query ([#5511](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5511))

# v2.2.1
Reaction v2.2.1 adds a bug fix and contains no breaking changes since v2.2.0

This release is being coordinated with `reaction-platform` and is designed to work with `v2.2.1` of `example-storefront` and `reaction-hydra`.

## Fixes

* fix: Checkout hangs on shipping methods step (#5516) and adds a migration to avoid breaking previous installations. The issue was caused by attempting to add a fulfillment method to a cart that included the prop `fulfillmentTypes`, which was not part of the `ShippingMethod` schema, which caused a validation error. This issue was resolved by adding the `fulfillmentTypes` prop to the `ShippingMethod` schema.

# v2.2.0

Reaction v2.2.0 adds minor features and performance enhancements, fixes bugs and contains no breaking changes since v2.1.0.

This release is being coordinated with `reaction-platform` and is designed to work with `v2.2.0` of `example-storefront` and `reaction-hydra`.

## Notable changes

### Elimination of all `eslint` warnings

The Reaction code base is now clean of all `eslint` warnings. Going forward, all `eslint` rules have been changed to `error`, and CI will fail if any are present.

### Product filtering by CSV

Admins can filter products by uploading a CSV in the product admin.

### Introduce Apollo hooks

Apollo has been updated to v3.0.0, which introduces GraphQL hooks into Reaction.

### Updated Orders Admin UI

The new Orders UI allows is completely GraphQL based and allows for updates to multiple fulfillment groups on each order.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4482263/63883915-12d30580-c98a-11e9-8484-debd9eda34ab.png)

### Remove Snyk as a CI step

Snyk was unable to work with PR's from forked repositories, which in turn caused every contribution to fail the CI check. We have removed Snyk as a blocking CI check because of this, and will run it locally on a schedule to still see which packages are in need of an update.

## Feature

- feat: add offset for pagination with tests ([#5228](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5228))
- feat: bulk actions UI updates ([#5461](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5461))

# v2.1.0

Reaction v2.1.0 adds minor features and performance enhancements, fixes bugs and contains no breaking changes since v2.0.0.

This release is being coordinated with `reaction-platform` and is designed to work with `v2.1.0` of `example-storefront` and `reaction-hydra`.

## Notable changes

### Introduction of Catalyst

Our new [Catalyst](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/catalyst) design system has been introduced into the Reaction codebase, and is used on various components including [`ConfirmDialog`](https://catalyst.reactioncommerce.com/#/Components/Feedback/ConfirmDialog) and [`Button`](https://catalyst.reactioncommerce.com/#/Components/Actions/Button). All new default component theme modifications must come from Catalyst.

### Tag slugs are now editable independently of tag name

Allows operators to change aa tag slug independently of a tag name.

### Order related GraphQL mutations

A `createRefund` GraphQL mutation has been added to allow refunds to be processed via GraphQL in addition to the existing meteor methods.

### Dataloaders introduced into the codebase

"`DataLoader` is a generic utility to be used as part of your application's data fetching layer to provide a simplified and consistent API over various remote data sources such as databases or web services via batching and caching."

Added the first couple of DataLoaders for Shops and SimpleInventory. Shops will benefit product listing pages as product and variant resolvers all query Shops collection for each product. SimpleInventory query benefits from batching.

### Bulk simple inventory mutation

When running large inventory import via an external sync system, the lack of a bulk mutation made the import takes many hours. This update introduces a bulk import option which cuts down import time significantly.

### Overhaul of `eslint` rules, and bulk fix of over 500 `eslint` warnings

We've updated to using v2.0.0 of our [Reaction ESLint Config](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-eslint-config) package, and have brought our `eslint` warnings down from 800 to under 300.

## Feature

# v2.0.0

Reaction v2.0.0—an API-first, real-time commerce engine built using Node.js, React, and GraphQL. It’s the second major release of our open source commerce software.

This release is coordinated with [Reaction Platform](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-platform) and is designed to work with the [Example Storefront](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/example-storefront) (previously Storefront Starter Kit) and `[reaction-hydra](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-hydra)`.

Reaction v2.0.0 is built as a truly headless commerce platform that decouples the Reaction backend services from the frontend. We’ve decoupled the storefront application from the API. Reaction platform now consists of the `reaction` project, which is now primarily our GraphQL API, and for the time being also our operator UI and our identity provider, along with our new to 2.0 [Example Storefront](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/example-storefront), built on Next.js, which connects with the Reaction application via GraphQL API to provide a customer-facing storefront. The legacy integrated Meteor storefront is no longer part of the Reaction project.



### Notable changes
Check out [previous release notes](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/releases) for details and associated issues and PRs.

**Operator experience and UI**
The store operator experience has been substantially enhanced from v1.x. We’ve shifted the operator UI for managing products from a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) product editor to one that is designed for greater flexibility. We have transitioned from a single-page admin experience to a full-page operator experience that’s fully separate from the storefront. The new operator UI uses 100% of the screen space for store management and operation, and will benefit users managing large product catalogs and complex fulfillment patterns.

![Reaction-product](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42009003/60613775-6d802480-9d80-11e9-86b5-a1683732ee3f.png)


![Reaction-product-variant](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42009003/60613799-72dd6f00-9d80-11e9-9012-ca59f509e5e3.png)


We’ve also added lots of new functionality around tags (tag dashboard and new tag management features), site [navigation](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4683) (including sitemaps and navigation tree editor), and fulfillment options (ability to add restrictions or surcharges based on product tags and/or customer location).

**GraphQL API coverage**
Most Meteor methods are removed in favor of the new GraphQL API. GraphQL is the only way to interact with the API from a storefront app. The operator UI uses a mixture of GraphQL and Meteor DDP while we complete the transition to GraphQL on the administrative side.

**Developer experience and performance**
For developers, we’ve made a number of enhancements to improve the overall developer experience, especially debugging, logging, and [updated documentation](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-docs/releases/tag/v2.0.0).
- Examples for how to [debug Node.js in Docker](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/next/testing-debugging-server-code#launch-the-application-in-inspect-mode)
- Better logging of packages and plugins loading
- `bin/setup` improvements
- Updated main Reaction app to use `.env` file ([#4826](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4826))
- [Added](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4943) `envalid` for validation of environment variables

We’ve made some tweaks to increase performance and improve initial boot time:
- Removed `reaction-cli` ([v2.0.0-rc.10](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v200-rc10))
- Added and removed a number of indexes since 1.x, see [#4819](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4819), [#5106](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5106), [#5090](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5090), etc. for examples

We’ve also improved Reaction’s extensibility in a number of ways, such as:
- Reaction now supports remote graphql schemas in plugins ([#4870](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4870))
- Plugins can now directly register React components ([#4875](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4875))
- Plugins can register functions to handle GraphQL transformation of catalog product media items ([#4988](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4988))
- There is now a `collections` option for `registerPlugin`, which allows plugins to define their MongoDB collections and indexes in a standard way ([#5196](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5196))

And finally, we’ve updated all Reaction dependencies (such as React and Apollo) to the latest versions, and updated our base docker image to use Meteor 1.8 ([#4760](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4760)).

**Security audit**
For the 2.0 release we’ve done a full security audit of the application, including cart, order methods, payment processing methods, and more, and fixed potential vulnerabilities.

**Other updates**
- Authentication is now handled via [Hydra](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/4618)
- Taxes have been completely re-worked in a new plugin ([v2.0.0-rc.10](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v200-rc10))
- Inventory has been moved into its own `simple-inventory` plugin, and is no longer directly tied to the `Products` collection
- Pricing has been moved into its own `simple-pricing` plugin, and allows for a 3rd party pricing service integration. ([#5014](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5014) & [#5143](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5143))
- Search plugins have been removed ([#5053](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5053))
- A plugin can now be used to override the default `orderId` and `cartId` and create IDs of a different type or in a specific order ([#5054](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5054))


### New documentation
See [this page](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-docs/releases/tag/v2.0.0) for a non-comprehensive list of new and updated docs.

Some highlights:
- A [Storefront UI Development guide](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/next/storefront-intro) answering "How do I build a storefront for Reaction or adapt my storefront to get its data from Reaction, without starting from an example app"
- Helpful info about [GraphQL Resolvers](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/graphql-resolvers-file-structure) and [extending GraphQL to add a field](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/how-to-extend-graphql-to-add-field)
- A guide for [“How To Extend the Product Schema”](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/how-to-extend-product)


### OS notes
**Support for Windows.**
`[reaction-platform](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-platform)` is not compatible with Windows and has not been fully tested on Windows at this time.

**MacOS and Linux are supported.**
Reaction will support development in a dockerized environment and will focus on tooling and documentation for installation and configuration on the macOS and Linux OSes.

# v2.0.0-rc.11

This is our eleventh **release candidate** for v2.0.0 of Reaction.
Please check it out and let us know what works and what doesn't for you.

This release is being coordinated with `reaction-platform` and is designed to work with the same versions of `reaction-next-starterkit` and `reaction-hydra`.

# Improvements

### App

Reaction is **no-longer** a customer-facing app, it's an administration tool and offers a GraphQL API.

All customer-facing views are the responsibility of a separate storefront app that makes use of the GaphQL API. See our [example storefront](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-next-starterkit) as an example of how to achieve this.

- All routes require admin authentication
- All non-admin authentication requests will be met with a logout screen if attempting to sign into the operator experience.
- All customer related authentication requests should be done with the IDP workflow. See our [example storefront](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-next-starterkit) as an example of how to achieve this.

Product grid and Product detail pages moved into the new operator experience and updated for that experience.

### Product grid

Product grid is now represented as a table in the new experience with the same bulk actions it had previously

- Product grid is now a table
- Product table supports multi-selection
- Product table supported bulk actions are "Make Hidden", "Make Visible", Archive, Duplicate and Publish
- Product table adds simple pagination controls with and items per page selector

### Product Detail Page

Is no longer a WYSIWYG editor.

All product forms have been moved on from the sidebar and into the main view and have been expanded.

- Product WYSIWYG editor has been replaced with standard forms
  - Product detail, Variant and Option forms have been moved out of the sidebar and into the primary view
- Template field has been converted to text field from a dropdown. Templates no longer apply to the PDP page in Reaction
- Tags can no longer be drag n' dropped to reorder. Drag handle has been removed to represent this.
- Media can be added to the Product, Variants, and Options
- Drag n' Drop of media and variants has been removed
  - Variants and Options can now be manually sorted by priority
  - Media can be sorted by priority manually
- Variant and Options forms now share the same fields

### User Profile

- The profile page has been moved to the new operator experience for admins
- Address form has been removed
- Order history has been removed
- Admins will be able to change their email and password

# Breaking Changes

Reaction is no-longer a customer-facing app, it's an administration tool and offers a GraphQL API.

We have removed the `search-mongo` and `ui-search` plugins from the `imports/plugins/included directory` of `reaction`. Which in turn removes `order search bar` from operator order UI. (#5053)

## Feature

- feat: remove search plugins (#5053)
- feat: allow users to disable plugins via config (#5031)
- feat: add addOrderFulfillmentGroup mutation (#5027)
- feat: add splitOrderItem mutation (#5024)
- feat: add updateOrderFulfillmentGroup mutation (#5020)
- feat: add updateOrder mutation (#5019)
- feat: add moveOrderItems mutation (#5018)
- feat: add cancelOrderItem mutation (#5010)

- feat: performance metrics integration with calibre (#5012)
- feat: simple-pricing plugin (#5014)
- feat: use .env.example files from custom plugins (#5003)

## Fix

- fix: bin/setup handling bad env.example (#5048)
- fix: naming issue caused taxes to not be calculated (#5043)
- fix: startup asset provisioning (#5033)
- fix: make bin/setup more robust to missing directories (#5026)
- fix: item subtotal is incorrect when additional quantities of the same item are added to cart (#5021)

## Chore

- chore: add better logging of package loading (#5051)
- chore: add optional first and last name fields to schemas (#5050)

# v2.0.0-rc.10

This is our tenth **release candidate** for v2.0.0 of Reaction.
Please check it out and let us know what works and what doesn't for you.

This release is being coordinated with `reaction-platform` and is designed to work with the same versions of `reaction-next-starterkit` and `reaction-hydra`.

# Improvements

### UI Removal

We have removed several UI components to transition and solidify that in 2.0 the application will only be used as an API and a UI for shop operators.

Additional PRs will be coming to remove other pieces of the storefront UI bit by bit until only an operator UI is left. (#4947 , #4948)

### Performance Tweaks

- We have done a bunch of performance tweaks to increase performance and initial boot time! We removed the `reaction-cli` with this update. (#4992)

### General

- We have added the ability for shops to apply surcharges depending on criteria for an order. (#4829)
- We have added a new Navigation Manager UI for Operator 2.0. (#4936)
- We have added [envalid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/envalid) as a dependency for validating environment variables. (#4983)

### GraphQL

- We have streamlined the way plugins register functions that can transform media objects for a product. (#4987)
- We have implemented GraphQL subscriptions support. (#4938)

### Custom Data

- We have added the capability to add a custom data object when placing an order. (#4962)
- We have added the capability for `calculateOrderTaxes` to return a custom data object. (#4955)

### Custom Plugins

- We have coalesced the separate env.example files from custom Reaction plugins into one file to reduce tedious integration steps. (#5003)

# Breaking Changes

### AppEvents

- We have replaced all `Hooks` usage with the newer `appEvents`. This does not break anything within the core and included plugins, however:
  If you use community or custom plugins that depend on the `@reactioncommerce/hooks` package, you will need to update or obtain updated versions that use `context.appEvents` instead.
  If you have a plugin that uses `MethodHook`s, update it to implement those hooks a different way.
  review all `appEvents` consumed and emitted by custom plugins. Update expected and emitted arguments. See the table. (#4915)

### Multiple Payment Support

- All of the individual `placeOrder*` GraphQL mutations provided by the built-in payment plugins are removed and replaced with a single `placeOrder` mutation which supports multiple payments. Any custom payment method plugins will break due to the removal of `createOrder` internal mutation. Look at all changes. (#4908)

### Surcharges

- When applying surcharges to certain methods, there is a delay in the update. (#4984)

### Updates

- Refactor`inventoryQuantity` to `inventoryInStock` in `Products` collection, update if used in your codebase. (#4930)

### Removals

- There is no longer a storefront catalog grid (#4973)
- There is no longer a Checkout UI (#4948)
- There is no longer a Cart UI (#4948)

# New Commands

In relation to improving performance, we have added new debugging statements (#4992)!

```
"inspect": "node --experimental-modules --inspect ./.reaction/run/index.mjs",
"inspect-brk": "node --experimental-modules --inspect-brk ./.reaction/run/index.mjs",

```

**Example Usage** :

docker-compose run --rm --service-ports reaction yarn run inspect --service-ports
```

# New Documents

We have added new documentation! :

- We officially stated that `reaction-platform` has not been fully tested or is compatible with Windows.
  https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/next/installation-reaction-platform
- We added a Storefront UI Development guide answering: "How do I build a storefront for Reaction or adapt my storefront to get its data from Reaction, without starting from an example app" (https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/next/storefront-intro)

# v2.0.0-rc.9

This is our ninth **release candidate** for v2.0.0 of Reaction. Please check it out and let us know what works and what doesn't for you.

This release is being coordinated with `reaction-platform` and is designed to work with the same versions of `reaction-next-starterkit` and `reaction-hydra`

## Inventory improvements

We've made some updates to the way inventory is tracked, introducing a new inventory field: `inventoryAvailableToSell`. This field tracks inventory that has been ordered, but has not yet been processed and so is still counted in-stock. This number is what is displayed to customers and determines whether a product is considered "sold out" or not. The old inventory number `inventoryQty` has been renamed to `inventoryInStock` and continues to represent the inventory available in stock. For more info see #4859.

## Breaking changes

### Inventory

- Migration 51 has been added to attach `inventoryAvailableToSell` to all products / variants, to correctly calculate the numbers on parent products / variants, and to publish this data to already published Catalog items.
- `currentQuantity` has been marked with `depreciated` in the cart. This isn't a breaking change at the moment, but lays the path to remove this field and replace with `inventoryAvailableToSell` and `inventoryInStock` in the future.
- `Catalog.getVariantQuantity` and `ReactionProduct.getVariantQuantity` have been removed. Custom plugins using these methods will need to be updated. The same data returned by these methods is now on the object that was being passed into these methods as the field `inventoryQuantity` or `inventoryAvailableToSell`
- Moved `isBackorder`, `isLowQuantity`, and `isSoldOut` functions from the `catalog` plugin to the new `inventory` plugin. Custom plugins using these methods will need to update their import path.

## Features

- feat: Add flag to enable only IDP routes (#4903)
- feat: Record plugin versions in DB and show in Shop panel (#4895)
- feat: Add support for fallback tax service (#4871)
- feat: Update to Apollo Server 2.0 (#4884)
- feat(#4848): Return only isVisible Tags, unless admin (#4879)
- feat: Support remote graphql schemas in plugins (#4870)
- feat: Support plugins directly registering React components (#4875)

- fix: add replace to remove comma from formatting (#4910)
- fix: add contentForLanguage resolver for nav item content (#4913)

- fix: Meteor method permissions fixes (#4883)
- fix: Multi-shop permission fixes (#4872)
- fix: check permissions for order workflow methods (#4863)

## Tests

# v2.0.0-rc.8

This is our eighth **release candidate** for v2.0.0 of Reaction. Please check it out and let us know what works and what doesn't for you.

## New Bits

### Operator 2.0

The core experience and UI for a shop operator using Reaction Commerce has not changed much over the last couple of years. We've been hard at work on the new and improved [storefront](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-next-starterkit) but until now have not revealed any of our design or plans for improving the updated operator UI.

This release includes the first beta of the new Reaction operator UI. Our focus with this new operator UI has several goals. First, we’re transitioning from a single page storefront and admin experience to a full page admin experience that will be separate from the storefront. . We believe this change is necessary and beneficial for anyone operating a store that works with a large number of products and/or does a high-volume of order. This change also decouples the customer facing storefront from the operator UI. The existing UI had a WYSIWYG flavor to it where the product and catalog management was done in an interface that was identical to what the customer saw. There are some benefits to this - having a good perspective of what your customers see when you make a change - but for large catalogs, it's not very practical. In addition, we’ve received feedback that the experience could be confusing for admin users who wanted to concentrate on their admin tasks only. Once decoupled the operator UI can use 100% of the screen space for store management and operation. The change will be a big benefit to users managing large product catalogs and complex fulfillment patterns.

Right now this new operator UI is opt-in and the existing, drawer style operator experience will continue to function as it has. You can access the new operator UI by visiting `/operator`.

<img width="1245" alt="operator_2 0" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/486340/48387165-7a44f080-e6a9-11e8-8977-75893be34ee2.png">

This UI should have all existing functionality baked in, but we anticipate that there may be some rough edges and from a user experience standpoint it is the first step on a longer path. The first step here has been to replicate existing functionality by moving existing components into the new layout and fixing bugs that we've found. Going forward, we'll be implementing improved UIs for many of the operator tools - Catalog Management, Inventory, Pricing, Order Management, etc.

Please file an issue for any bugs that you find, whether they be weird UI quirks or things that don't as expected.

### .env file

Most services that make up the Reaction platform use a .env file in the root of the service folder to define environment variables that should be set while running. They also have a pre-build script that the reaction-platform tool runs to create or update the .env file from a .env.example file, which is committed. Until now, this project did not use `.env` file, so we've added one. See https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4826 for more details.

## Improved Bits

### Support for extending GraphQL enums and unions

We've updated GraphQL and GraphQL Tools to new versions and added support for `extend enum` and `extend union`. This permits extending the core schema in this way from a plugin. See https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4798 for more details

### Developer performance

When we introduced `reaction-platform` and begun developing in Docker environments, we began to notice high CPU utilization that for those of us developing on OSX.

<img width="1143" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1203639/51052875-dc787f80-158c-11e9-9f16-60f81e43b4ec.png">

Long story short, this is an [issue with filesystem operations in Docker for Mac](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1759#issue-237416539) and there's not much we can do to resolve the core issue. In development mode, we leverage Meteor to watch for file changes. By adjusting the polling interval for the Meteor file watcher, we can greatly reduce the issues introduced by Docker for Mac. We've set two environment variables in the example .env file `.env.example` (https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4826) as follows, but if these don't work for you, I'd start by adjusting the polling interval to something higher - 20000 (20s) or 30000 (30s). If you're working directly on the core `reaction` project, this may impact how long it takes before a change you've made is recognized and rebuilt, but that may be a small price to pay to reduce CPU burn by hyperkit. There shouldn't be any other consequences to increasing this number.

```
  METEOR_DISABLE_OPTIMISTIC_CACHING=1
  METEOR_WATCH_POLLING_INTERVAL_MS=10000
```

## Breaking changes

This release contains a number of breaking changes that we've been working to get into Reaction before we cut the final 2.0.0 release. If you're planning to update an existing shop, please read through this list

### Catalog

- Added a new, final param to xformVariant with the processed inventory flags (https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4742)

### Meteor Methods

- Payment plugins that use Meteor methods for capture and refund will not be compatible with this PR. This is intentional as we're migrating toward GraphQL and away from Meteor Methods for client-server interaction. Custom payment methods will need to be rewritten to follow the pattern in #4803. (https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4803)
- If a custom plugin uses any of these methods, it will need to be updated. (https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4815)
  - `shop/getBaseLanguage`
  - `shop/getCurrencyRates`
  - `shop/getWorkflow`
  - `getTemplateByName`
  - `orders/addOrderEmail`
  - `taxes/updateTaxCode`
  - `workflow/coreOrderWorkflow/coreOrderProcessing`
  - `workflow/coreOrderWorkflow/coreOrderCompleted`
- Custom code relying on being able to call the "accounts/sendWelcomeEmail" Meteor method will break. Calls from client code must be removed. Calls from server code should be updated to import and call the util function. (https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4867)

### Taxes

- We've created a new `taxes-rates` plugin in the `included` folder, and all features related to custom rates have been moved there. This includes the "Custom Rates" panel in tax settings; the `Taxes` collection and its related schemas; the "taxes/addRate", "taxes/editRate", and "taxes/deleteRate" Meteor methods, and the "Taxes" Meteor publication.
- The core `taxes` plugin has a new API for registering tax services (such as the included "Custom Rates" service, or a custom Avalara service for example). They are registered by passing in a `taxServices` array to `registerPackage` (example and details in #4785)
- Some tax-related fields on Cart, CartItem, Order, OrderFulfillmentGroup, and OrderItem have been moved, renamed, added, or removed. We've attempted to remove all unused fields, and group or rename other fields for clarity. One example is the `taxes` array, which now has a different schema and appears for individual items as well as the full cart or order fulfillment group.
- On `Products` documents, `taxable` is now `isTaxable`. This change had previously been made in the `Catalog` schema and now is made in `Products` to match.
- For the Custom Rates plugin, be aware that the `taxCode` value is now used for filtering which products should be taxed at that rate. This requires a review of all your products to ensure that they have a tax code specified, in addition to being marked as taxable. If you'd rather not do this review, you can revert to the old behavior of ignoring tax codes by editing each of your Custom Rates entries, clearing the the "Tax Code" field, and saving.
- _If you are upgrading from 1.x and use only Custom Rates for taxes, data migrations should provide a seamless transition. Most tax changes are breaking only for third-party non-included tax plugins. However, please verify after upgrading that the correct tax service is active._

### Address Validation

Breaking changes to how address validation works. Affects all plugins that provide address validation and all clients that validate addresses. (https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4767)

### Configuration

- Propel was updated and any propel scripts must be updated. (https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4802)
- If you run Reaction locally, such as for development, you will now need to be sure there is a `.env` file with correct environment variables set in it. The `.env.example` file, with no changes, should work for most people. When running with reaction-platform, this should happen automatically. But if you've already been developing locally and you pull in this change, you'll need to run bin/setup once. You can also run bin/setup anytime you pull in the future, to add any new ENV variables. (https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4826)
- Docker network streams.reaction.localhost must be created, which developers can do by pulling down the latest reaction-platform and running make (or make network-create if they want to be surgical about it). (https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4805)

### Meteor Plugins

- Custom plugins that rely on the dispatch:run-as-user Meteor package will need to find a different solution and remove the dependent code. (https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4825)

# v2.0.0-rc.7

This is our seventh **release candidate** for v2.0.0 of Reaction. Please check it out and let us know what works and what doesn't for you.

## Security Release

This security release addresses to potential vulnerabilities

1. We discovered a vulnerability that affects shops built on Reaction Commerce that use the Reaction-Social plugin with Facebook and the Facebook App Secret configured. More details on this issue below.

2. Remove dependency on `event-stream`

## Event Stream Dependency Removal

This fix removes a dependency on `event-stream` introduced by `nodemon` via `pstree` by bumping `nodemon` and `pstree.remy` through `nodemon` to a version that does not include `pstree`.

[event-stream](https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream/issues/116) had a malicious bit of code added to version `3.3.6` which has since been removed from github and appears to have specifically targeted [copay](https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/9346).

# v2.0.0-rc.6

This is our sixth **release candidate** for v2.0.0 of Reaction. Please check it out and let us know what works and what doesn't for you.

## Meteor 1.8 Final

We've been using a release candidate of Meteor 1.8 in all of our 2.0 release candidates to this point - this has also included release candidate versions of Babel 7. In this release we're updating to the final version of Meteor 1.8 and Babel 7.

There are a lot of great updates that are included in Meteor 1.8 and you can read all about them in the [Meteor blog](https://blog.meteor.com/meteor-1-8-erases-the-debts-of-1-7-77af4c931fe3). I think the one that we'll notice the most is significant improvement to build performance that. We've been focused on improving the performance and developer experience with Reaction for a while now and this update makes significant progress towards improving the developer experience and build times. Anyone who's been using Reaction for a while should notice big improvements to the amount of time it takes for the app to rebuild after making changes.

We're still working with Node.js 8.11.4 as the upgrade to Node 8.12.0 got postponed to the Meteor 1.8.1 release. If you're itching to play with it, you can run `meteor update --release 1.8.1-beta.n` from the directory that you've got the core `reaction` project installed. There may be some additional speed improvements related to Meteor's use of `Fiber`s that come along in this version.

We've also updated the our base docker image to use Meteor 1.8 (#4760)

## Email Sending

We've extracted the core email sending functionality into a new `reaction-email-smtp` plugin which is `included` and created a new `sendEmail` event which is emitted for each email job. The core smtp email plugin now listens for these events and sends an email if an SMTP provider is configured. By doing this we've made it possible to create plugins which send emails via an API rather than via SMTP.

The email provider config form found at Dashboard -> Emails -> Mail Provider is now also able to be overridden. Plugins can use register.js to provide a React component to use here.

## GraphQL API

Added a primaryShop GraphQL query & resolver, eliminating the need to first query for the primary shop ID, followed by another query for shop by ID.

## Breaking Changes

In #4749 we changed the names of our included payment method plugins. We've included a migration to automatically update any existing installation, but if you have custom code that relies on these payment method names you may need make some changes.

## Fixes

- fix: keep toggles shown, width 100% in action view (#4772)
- fix: Use babel.config.js to fix Jest tests in custom plugins with package.json (#4782)

## Features

- feat: decouple SMTP email sending logic from core to allow plugins to override (#4740)
- feat: Add a CORS-enabled endpoint for token refresh in Hydra plugin (#4743)
- feat: GraphQL query & resolver for loading the primary shop (#4747)
- feat: update to Meteor 1.8 final (#4753)
- feat: update to base image 1.8 (#4760)
- feat: client ui payment methods (#4749) .. Resolves #4719
- feat: added migration for adding available payment methods to shops. (#4729)
- feat: use GraphQL for payment methods operator ui (#4749) .. Resolves #4719

## Migrations

- chore: added migration for adding available payment methods to shops. (#4729)

## Chores

We've been ignoring some of our integration tests as the in-memory MongoDB they rely on has not been working effectively. Previously we did this by skipping our entire `test:integration` tests in CI, we're now just skipping the tests that are failing due to this db incompatibility and have plans to address this soon.

- chore: Skip failing integration tests (#4751)
- chore: Deploy release branches to staging ECS environment (#4758)

# v2.0.0-rc.5

This is our fifth **release candidate** for v2.0.0 of Reaction. Please check it out and let us know what works and what doesn't for you.

## Mongo replica set issue

Many people were having issues with the Mongo replica-set image starting before the Mongo database was ready. This could cause the replica-set to fail and the application to hang during startup in a development environment. This is fixed in #4748 by waiting for mongo to be reachable within the reaction container before connecting to it, and creating the DB if needed, initiating the replica set if needed, and waiting for the replica set to be OK. This fix should solve the docker-compose startup race conditions we've been seeing. (#4748)

## GraphQL

We've added two new GraphQL queries for payment methods. A query `paymentMethods` which will list all registered payment methods and is restricted to operators and `availablePaymentMethods` which will list all payment methods which have been enabled. These new queries were added in #4709. We've also added a GraphQL mutation that permits an operator to enable or disable a payment method for a shop in #4739

We've updated the CartItems and OrderItems GraphQL queries to include a `productTags` resolver which will return the tags for the CartItem or OrderItem. The new resolvers and updated schemas were added in #4715 and #4732

There is a new GraphQL mutation for generating sitemaps `generateSitemaps` this replaces the `sitemaps/generate` meteor method. method. (#4708)

## Classic Storefront UI Updates

We've replaced the customer facing Product Grid in the Classic Storefront UI with our [CatalogGrid](https://designsystem.reactioncommerce.com/#!/CatalogGrid) component from the Reaction Design System. This was accomplished in #4649

There's a new "Include in sitemap?" checkbox in the Product Settings when using the operator interface to edit product information. This was added to make it possible to exclude published products from the sitemap. (#4708)

## Additional Plugin Capabilities

A plugin can now include a `catalog` object in `registerPackage`, with `customPublishedProductFields` and `customPublishedProductVariantFields` that are set to arrays of property names. These will be appended to the core list of fields for which published status should be tracked. This is used to build the hashes that are used to display an indicator when changes need to be published. (#4738)

A plugin can now use the `functionsByType` pattern to register one or more functions of type "publishProductToCatalog", which are called with `(catalogProduct, { context, product, shop, variants })` and expected to mutate `catalogProduct` if necessary. (#4738)

## nvmrc

Even though most of the development work happens in Docker, getting the right version of node available directly in the host OS is convenient for setting up eslint integration with your editor. We've added an `.nvmrc` file for this as [we've recommended](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/recommended-tools#general) `nvm` for installing and managing NodeJS in our docs for some time now.

## Public API Changes

We've changed the GraphQL schema for `PaymentMethod@name` from `PaymentMethodName` to `String`. `PaymentMethodName` was a subset of string and this should not cause any issues.

## Breaking Changes

WE've replaced the `generateSitemaps` Meteor method with a GraphQL mutation. See #4708 for details.

Because we've replaced the customer facing Product Grid UI in the Classic Storefront UI, if you had any plugins which relied on specific selectors or the structure of the existing UI, those may need to be updated.

## Features

- feat: payment methods (#4709) .. Resolves #4574
- feat: enable payment method for shop (#4739) .. Resolves #4718
- feat: use component library's CatalogGrid - 2.0 (#4649)
- feat: add product tags to cart items (#4715)
- feat: Add product tags to order item (#4732)
- feat: option to choose whether a product should appear in the sitemap (#4708)
- feat: add a way to extend catalog product publication (#4738)

## Fixes

- fix: Auth Consent scopes issue (#4733)
- fix: 4722 compareAtPrice - convert from Float to Money (#4731)
- fix(startup): init mongo replica set after waiting for connection (#4748)

## Chores

- chore: add .nvmrc configuration file (#4744)

## Docs

- docs: Link readers to Reaction Platform install instructions (#4724)
- docs: fix jsdoc copypasta on waitForReplica checkWaitRetry (#4723)

# v2.0.0-rc.4

This is our fourth **release candidate** for v2.0.0 of Reaction. Please check it out and let us know what works and what doesn't for you.

## Improving Jest test performance in CI

We started seeing unit tests timing out in CI in the morning on Friday October 5. It doesn't appear that this was caused by a change in our `jest` version as we were able to reproduce the issues on older branches which were previously passing.
This is resolved in #4176 by changing our `test:unit` script in `package.json` to run jest with the `--maxWorkers=4` flag. This resolved our issue with tests timing out, and improves test performance in CI overall. This is suggested in the troubleshooting jest here: https://jestjs.io/docs/en/troubleshooting.html#tests-are-extremely-slow-on-docker-and-or-continuous-integration-ci-server

## Checkout Totals

There were some cases in the Classic Storefront UI where there would be a discrepancy between the total calculated on the server and the price calculated by the client.
This is not an issue in the [Next.js Storefront](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-next-starterkit) as all price values are calculated on the server. This is resolved in #4701

## Bugfixes

fix: round total when verifying it on order create (#4701) .. Resolves #4684

## Chores

fix: limit jest maxWorkers to 4 to improve CI perf (#4716)

# v2.0.0-rc.3

This is our third **release candidate** for v2.0.0 of Reaction. Please check it out and let us know what works and what doesn't for you.

A few files snuck into our last release that had incorrect jsdoc syntax in the form of `@return <Promise>Type`
The jsdoc parser is unable to parse any return type starting with a `<` and throws an error. This error is thrown during the Deploy Docs CI step and causes that step of the CI to fail. This is resolved in #4704 by fixing the jsdoc to use the correct Promise syntax `@return Promise<Type>`

## Bugfixes

- fix: resolve errors in jsdoc Promise returns (#4704)

# v2.0.0-rc.2

This is our second **release candidate** for v2.0.0 of Reaction. Please check it out and let us know what works and what doesn't for you.

### OAuth Flow

- Get the auth URL connected to the Login request from Hydra. Get the loginAction field and pass it in the UI route query param (?action={loginAction}) to serve as state info to the Login component.(#4651)
- Update the Auth components to show appropriate form fields based on route query param (e.g ?action=signin)(#4651)
- Update the SignIn and SignUp core components to have a new hasSwitchLinks prop. This will determine if link to toggle between SignIn and SignUp views should be displayed. It defaults to true (so previous behaviour is kept - no breaking change)(#4651)
- Update Auth container for OAuth IDP flow with hasSwitchLinks=false. This makes the state of the form depend on ONLY the route query (#4651)
- Fix the Hydra session feature. Now, when a user who already signed in (and is sill within the set HYDRA_SESSION_LIFESPAN), tries to login again, we won't show the login form again.(#4651)
- Add /logout endpoint for Consumer apps (like Starterkit) to call to delete user sessions from Hydra. The delete session endpoint in Hydra lives on the Administrative port (4445), so we are not exposing it to Consumer apps to consume directly.(#4651)

## Taxes

If item.tax did not exist the getTaxTotal was returning NaN which would show up in cart totals. This was introduced in #4664 and is resolved in #4670

## Operator UI for editing product information

On the PDP, when typing a tag name in the admin sidebar, a console error would appear: `Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read property 'getShopId' of undefined at getShopLang (helpers.js:118)`. This was because `Reaction` was undefined when `getShopLang()` would run. This is resolved in #4673

## Fixes

- (fix) Properly return 0 when no tax items are present (#4670)
- fix: Show correct form state during create account oauth flow (#4651)
- Fix: console error when typing a tag name on PDP (#4673)
- fix: discounts and profile orders in 2.0 (#4674)
- fix: orders dashboard layout issue (#4688)
  Updated a few panel styles to fit within the viewport better and not end up behind the "modal overlay"

## Chores

- chore: updating get in touch link (#4676)
- chore: fix broken link in README to schema docs (#4672)

# v2.0.0-rc.1

This is our first **release candidate** for v2.0.0 of Reaction. Please check it out and let us know what works and what doesn't for you.

In many ways this may better mark the beginning of a new way to develop for Reaction rather than the end of a big development cycle. Make no mistake, there are some pretty great things that v2.0.0 includes - for example, our GraphQL API now covers the basic commerce flow, from browsing a catalog all the way through checkout. However, this release is also bigger in many ways that just this repository. Much of our work over the past several months has gone into repositories other than this primary `/reaction` one.

We've created a component library called the [Reaction Design System](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-component-library) which we're announcing the initial "alpha" for. While it's still subject to change, there are a lot of very useful commerce focused components that we've built that live there. We'll have a link to the styleguidist playground up soon where you can play with and read the docs for each component.

Our new GraphQL API has enabled us to build a new UI Client for Reaction that we're calling our [NextJS Starter Kit](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-next-starterkit). This new UI client provides a reference storefront implementation that communicates with the Reaction API exclusively via GraphQL, eliminating some of the sluggishness that was associated with our Classic UI built on Meteor. This new client is built with NextJS and provides Server Side Rendering (SSR) out of the box, as well as (Segment compatible analytics event tracking)[https://segment.com/docs/spec/ecommerce/v2/]. We'll recommend this as the best way to build a storefront UI for Reaction going forward.

We're also introducing a new OpenID Connect OAuth2 Service which uses [Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra) to enable our new UI Client to leverage our existing Meteor based Identities and roles.

These services all run together to form the Reaction Platform (working title, subject to change) - and we've got a new project called [Reaction Platform](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-platform) which will help you get everything connected and launched together.

This changelog may feel somewhat insignificant because in part, we've been releasing bits of what is becoming 2.0.0 over the last several releases and much of the new development is happening outside of the `/reaction` repository.

## Marketplace Updates

When multiple shops match the searched domain, prioritize the Primary Shop. This is important when searching for "shop settings" which are only stored on the Primary Shop (e.g., smtp settings).

## Breaking Changes

From #4622

- Orders-related GraphQL schemas and significant changes to the Orders MongoDB schemas to better match GraphQL. See the diffs for the schema files. Two changes of note are that order.items and order.billing arrays no longer exist. Instead, each item in order.shipping has an items array and a single payment object on it. The payment object is also flattened and unused properties have been removed from it.
- context.queries and context.mutations are no longer namespaced. This simplifies things and makes it possible for one plugin to overwrite another plugin's functions if necessary.

- Some Meteor methods are removed:

  - cart/copyCartToOrder (replaced by createOrder mutation)
  - cart/submitPayment (replaced by createOrder mutation)
  - discounts/transaction
  - discounts/calculate
  - discounts/codes/credit (replaced by a function registered with the same name using functionsByType)
  - discounts/codes/discount (replaced by a function registered with the same name using functionsByType)
  - discounts/codes/sale (replaced by a function registered with the same name using functionsByType)
  - discounts/codes/shipping (replaced by a function registered with the same name using functionsByType)
  - shipping/updateShipmentQuotes
  - shipping/provider/toggle
  - shipping/rates/add (replaced with createFlatRateFulfillmentMethod GraphQL mutation)
  - shipping/rates/update (replaced with updateFlatRateFulfillmentMethod GraphQL mutation)
  - shipping/rates/delete (replaced with deleteFlatRateFulfillmentMethod GraphQL mutation)
  - taxes/calculate (replaced by non-Meteor getFulfillmentGroupItemsWithTaxAdded)
  - taxes/setRateByShopAndItem (replaced by non-Meteor getFulfillmentGroupItemsWithTaxAdded)
  - notification/send (replaced by non-Meteor createNotification function)
  - notification/delete (was unused)
  - stripe/payment/createCharges (replaced by placeOrderWithStripeCardPayment and placeMarketplaceOrderWithStripeCardPayment GraphQL mutations)

- shipping/updateParcelSize Meteor method is renamed to shop/updateDefaultParcelSize and moved to core/shop service
- Meteor UI client checkout code now places orders using GraphQL
- Add orderById GraphQL query
- The "afterCartUpdate" hooks are now called with just (updatedCart) rather than the redundant (updatedCartId, updatedCart)
- The way that orders are placed is now different. See "Order Changes" heading
- Orders can no longer be created without an email address
- The process by which plugins are asked to provide available fulfillment methods + quotes for them is changed. Rather than calling registered hooks, it calls all functions registered with the name "getFulfillmentMethodsWithQuotes" (See getFulfillmentMethodsWithQuotes.js)
- The "example" payment method form is now an "IOU" form that collects only a full name. It previously had a fake credit card form, which might have been misleading. Now it is clear that it's for demo and trial purposes only. Also, this new form is in React.
- Some unused (by core) functions have been removed from the cartOrder.js transforms that are available on Cart and Order documents in Meteor.

Previously client code would tell the server to "copy cart to order". Now, the orders plugin is mostly unaware of what a cart is. The client is responsible for converting a cart (which is a work-in-progress order) into the OrderInput schema and placing an order using that.

Related to this, payment information is now never stored on the cart. It is collected during checkout and sent with the placeOrder call. An order will only be placed if charges are successfully created using the provided payment details.

The orders service is largely unaware of how payment is done, and there is no generic placeOrder mutation. Instead, plugins that provide payment methods are expected to provide GraphQL mutations that allow you to place and pay for an order using that method. Most of the logic is shared, and is encapsulated in a createOrder mutation that the orders plugin provides. But each payment method plugin wraps the createOrder mutation to handle payment specifics.

All Meteor UI checkout code is updated to place orders using the new GraphQL mutations. The Meteor methods formerly involved in placing orders and payments are removed.

There are currently three included payment methods, each with their own place order mutation:

    placeOrderWithExampleIOUPayment
    placeOrderWithStripeCardPayment
    placeMarketplaceOrderWithStripeCardPayment

For production, use placeOrderWithStripeCardPayment. placeOrderWithExampleIOUPayment is included for demo purposes and does not require any external services. placeMarketplaceOrderWithStripeCardPayment is part of the "marketplace" plugin, which is not fully implemented or supported. Each payment method has its own checkout UI component, which collects whatever information it needs securely.

We've updated the password reset flow to use a full page in #4637

- Move previous Password Reset modal to a dedicated page on /reset-password/:token
- Rename the affect components to not have modal suffixes
- Show a message on successful reset of the password (previously, the modal closes)

In #4613 we've renamed the Docker network on which GraphQL enabled web services are attached to `api.reaction.localhost` Networks in the Docker environment should be named as \*.reaction.localhost. The localhost TLD is reserved and guaranteed to not conflict with a real TLD.

- To enable network communication, projects communicating with Reaction's GraphQL server must be on the api.reaction.localhost Docker network.
- PRs related to reactioncommerce/reaction#4447 should be coordinated.

We've [moved the SMS schema](https://github.com/reaction-contrib/meteor-notifications-sms) to the SMS package in contrib in #4566

# v1.17.1

## Security Release

This security release addresses to potential vulnerabilities

1. We discovered a vulnerability that affects shops built on Reaction Commerce that use the Reaction-Social plugin with Facebook and the Facebook App Secret configured. More details on this issue below.

2. Remove dependency on `event-stream`

## Event Stream Dependency Removal

This fix removes a dependency on `event-stream` introduced by `nodemon` via `pstree` by bumping `nodemon` and `pstree.remy` through `nodemon` to a version that does not include `pstree`.

[event-stream](https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream/issues/116) had a malicious bit of code added to version `3.3.6` which has since been removed from github and appears to have specifically targeted [copay](https://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/9346).

# v1.17.0

This release contains mostly bug fixes, many of which are focused on Marketplace implementations. Thanks to @pmn4 for contributing many of the marketplace fixes and additions.

There's also a little bit of cleanup of unused code in this release. This will likely be our last release on the 1.x line as our new work is focused on our 2.x version.

## Sitemap Generator

A sitemap generator plugin that creates and stores XML for a sitemap index, as well as sitemaps for tag pages, PDPs, and arbitrary URLs that can be added via an event hook.

There is a recurring job that runs every 24 hours (the specific interval can be changed) that generates the sitemaps. There is also a button to manually trigger a refresh, at Dashboard -> Shop -> Options - along with a notification that appears when it's completed.

## Use our GraphQL API for the Product Grid within the Meteor App

As part of our push towards our GraphQL API, we've started to leverage the API inside of our existing Meteor app. This release converts our customer facing product grid from using Meteor Pub/Sub to consuming data from our GraphQL API instead. This is the first step in an ongoing initiative to start using the GraphQL API inside of our existing monolithic commerce application. See #4481 for a list of files changed.

## GraphQL Checkout

This release includes the first set of GraphQL APIs designed for stepping through a checkout. While we've started to consume this API within our Storefront Starter Kit, these APIs should be treated as unstable and subject to change. We've added mutations for setting an anonymous email - `setEmailOnAnonymousCart` and selecting fulfillment options - `selectFulfillmentOptionForGroup`.

**A note on fulfillment options**
Fulfillment options are what we're calling what used to be shipment options. In order to prepare ourselves for several types of fulfillment that do not necessarily include shipping, we're updating the checkout through order models, methods, and now our GraphQL API to be capable of grouping items into "Fulfillment Groups". This opens the door for several new types of fulfillments down the line such as In Store Pickup, Digital Downloads, Digital Key Generation, and anything else you can think up. We're not actively building any of these different fulfillment types into core, but want to ensure that it's possible and there's a clear direction to do so.

## Breaking Changes

- If a plugin adds an "afterCartUpdate" hook, it will no longer be called. Change the plugin code to use appEvents.on("afterCartUpdate" instead. (#4535)
- If a plugin creates or updates a cart, be sure it calls appEvents.emit("afterCartCreate") or appEvents.emit("afterCartUpdate"), respectively, passing the proper arguments. If you do this within an appEvents.on hook for the same event, be sure to wrap the call in conditional logic to avoid an infinite loop. (#4535)
- We've refactored the `Shipment` schema to remove the `items` property. This will cause a breaking change for plugins expecting the items property to be there. Such plugins should be updated to use a combination of itemIds and the main items list. (#4531)
- Removed `requiresShipping` prop from products and catalog products. This has been replaced by an array `supportedFulfillmentTypes`. Reaction's core admin interface did not provide a method for setting this prop, and we've left the `supportedFulfillmentTypes` out of the exiting operator interface. This change will emable us to show a "Shipping"/"Pick Up" selector for other items down the road. Will also permit creation of digital fulfillment types, etc. (#4554)
- The last argument of the setShipmentMethod Meteor method now expects just the method ID rather than the whole method object. Core client code has been updated, but you should update any custom code that calls this method.
- Removed the resetShipmentMethod Meteor method
- The `cart/setAnonymousUserEmail` Meteor method is removed. This does not break any core behavior, but it might require updates to any custom plugins.

# v1.14.0

## Removing Optional Plugins

As part of our focus simplifying the core Reaction application and improving performance, we've [made the decision to remove optional plugins from the core application](https://blog.reactioncommerce.com/the-road-ahead-product-updates-june-2018/). From our blog post on this topic:

> It’s about quality over quantity. As a part of our initiative to simplify Reaction, we’re focusing on providing one reference application per feature and moving all others over to community-sponsored packages. We’ll be migrating packages, APIs, and schemas over to npm. It’s a standard approach to package management, one that improves the developer experience overall.

Here’s how it will look:

| Category   | Reaction default(s)             | Community package(s)             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Payments   | Stripe, example payment package | PayPal, Authorize.net, Braintree |
| Taxes      | Flat rate                       | Avalara, TaxCloud, TaxJar        |
| Shipping   | Flat rate                       | Shippo                           |
| Connectors | CSV connector                   | Shopify connector                |

As the first step of this process we've moved a number of packages from the https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction repo to independent repositories in the new https://github.com/reaction-contrib organization. You can install these packages by following the instructions located inside of each new repository. Once installed they should work as they did in v1.13. Any issues you have with updating these packages should be filed in the repos created for these packages and not in the core Reaction repo going forward. If you're interested in contributing to or helping to maintain any of the packages that we've moved to reaction-contrib, please reach out to @zenweasel and he can get you setup.

The list of packages that have been removed in this release is as follows:

- Shopify
- TaxCloud
- Avalara
- Authorize.net
- Paypal
- Braintree
- TaxJar
- Advanced Inventory Management
- Shippo
- SMS
- Discount Rates (unused, not the same as our current discount codes)
- Logging (unused by core application)

This work is listed as a breaking change. If your application relies on any of these packages, you will have to install them independently of Reaction going forward. This release will not destroy data associated with these plugins, so you should be able to safely update without losing information. However, please be sure to test this for your specific application before deploying to production and as always, backup your data before updating versions.

## GraphQL Cart

This release contains the Cart and Checkout GraphQL schemas along with several cart queries and mutations. We're starting to make some changes to the core cart schemas for Reaction and the process that we use to create and identify carts.

One of these changes is when we create a cart for a customer. To this point, we've created a cart document for each and every visitor to a Reaction storefront. Going forward we'll be creating carts on demand. This means that a customer will not have a cart associated with them until they first add a product to the cart. This is how we've architected the GraphQL API to work and we've made some changes to the legacy Reaction cart system to put it in sync.

We're signifincantly adjusting the Cart schema as well. The best way to understand all of this will be to read through the updated GraphQL Cart Schema in #4307 and #4390 but I'll try to note some things to be aware of going forward.

A cart will have either an account associated with it or may be anonymous.

A cart will have an array of items associated with them. As we will be lazy in creating carts, when the cart is created this array of items will have at least one item in it. We do not destory carts if a customer removes all items from a cart, so it is possible that there will be an empty array of items inside of a cart.

One of the major changes to carts is related to how we store information necessary to create an order from a cart. We're introducing a new field `checkout` to the cart schema which you can dig into in #4309. This will be where fulfillment information, payment information, addresses and any other information necessary to process a checkout will be stored.

Recognizing the need to be able to handle orders which have items that require different types of fulfillment, we're organizing items into what we're calling "Fulfillment Groups." The most basic example is that a fulfillment group could be a group of items that is getting shipped to a specific address. For an order with `n` items, there can exist up to `n` fulfillment groups within that cart. This specific release doesn't introduce any new functionality for adding new types of fulfillment groups or splitting a single cart into multiple fulfillments, but it does lay the groundwork for splitting orders, creating new fulfillment types such as an in store pickup, ship to store, digital downloads, or generated license keys.

We're currently mapping this new GraphQL Schema to the existing Reaction Simple Schema, but will be transitioning all of our existing schemas to match (more or less) our new GraphQL schemas going forward.

A cart will still be associated with a single shop. This is consistent with current behavior.

There are two GraphQL Queries for fetching carts, one for getting anonymous carts `anonymousCartByCartId` and one for getting account carts `accountCartByAccountId`

This release introduces GraphQL Mutations for creating carts, adding items to carts, removing items from carts, updating cart items, and reconciling carts when a customer with an anonymous cart logs into an account.

`ReconcileCarts` is a new method which replaces and extends our previous `mergeCarts` method with additional functionality. ReconcileCarts has 3 modes: `merge`, `keepAnonymousCart`, and `keepAccountCart`. `merge` is the default mode and works identically to how the existing `mergeCarts` method works, where the anonymous cart is combined with the account cart, items are deduped, and quantities are incremented to match the combined qty of the items in the carts. `keepAnonymousCart` will keep only the items and the checkout information in the anonymous cart, and `keepAccountCart` will do the same but for the Account Cart.

## Breaking Changes

### Meteor App

#### File Organization

- We've moved all files from `/server` into plugins. All imports with paths that begin with /server will need to be changed for any custom code or community plugins. See the file changes in https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4366/files to see examples of changing import paths from `/server` to relevant plugin paths.

#### Cart

- A cart is not created until items are added. Previously a cart was created for all users, including anonymous users, immediately if one was not found. This is not a breaking change for the core app, but any custom plugins may have code that will need to be updated to handle the possibility of there not being a cart.
- Update the signature of most cart methods to take an optional cartToken string param. Update all places that call these methods to pass in the token for anonymous carts.
- Carts and Orders no longer have userId. They now have accountId. Core client code has been updated, but custom code will need to look up the account for the user and then look up the cart or order from that.
- The CartItem SimpleSchema no longer includes variants and product, i.e., the entire variant and product objects are not copied to the cart item. Instead, certain properties that are needed are copied directly to the CartItem object. For example, item.productSlug. See the updated schema.
- `cart/removeCart` Meteor method behavior is the same as before, but the return value is now `{ cart }`
- The signature of the "cart/setAnonymousUserEmail" method has changed. It now takes cartId, token arguments. The client code that calls it has been updated, but any custom code calling it will need to be updated.
- Accounts.loginWithAnonymous is no longer available to client code. This was only used in one place, and similar logic has replaced it in that spot.
- workflow/pushCartWorkflow and workflow/revertCartWorkflow methods now require that you pass in the cartId rather than guessing which cart you intend.
- In general, be aware that cart.accountId may now be null. Previously, it would be set even for anonymous carts, to the account for the user with "anonymous" role. For now, order.accountId is still set after an anonymous order is placed.
- The "Reaction.sessionId" stored ID is now used only for auto-login of anonymous users. It is not used by any of the cart code. Also, the "Sessions" collection is no longer written to or published to clients. It will not be dropped automatically, but you can drop it if you no longer need it.

#### Checkout

- Stripe checkout now uses [Stripe Elements](https://stripe.com/elements) - for more details see #4325

#### Tags

- We're now limiting the tags publication to show only tags from the current active shop. This is more of a clarification of how this was supposed to work, but if you depended on all tags being published, this will cause unexpected behavior. See #4206 for specific changes.

#### Other

- Removal of previously included ancillary packages listed in the "Removing Optional Plugins" section
- The function `createCatalogProduct` has been moved into it's own file. This function was not being exported and should not create any issues, but be aware.
- The Catalog schema has been changed. It was in a "use at your own risk" state before this, but if you've been using it you may have to migrate some data
- We've removed the core plugin `Logging` which was used only by the Avalara plugin to this point. If you relied on this plugin, you'll need to reinstall it.

### GraphQL

- In the GraphQL context, there is no longer a methods object. Instead you can call any method with context.callMeteorMethod(name, ...args).
- In the GraphQL context, context.queries is now namespaced by which plugin the queries come from. For example, context.queries.userAccount is now context.queries.accounts.userAccount.

## Notable Features

### Deploy to Heroku Button

We've added a deploy to Heroku button which should appear in the project readme now. You can now deploy Reaction to Heroku by clicking the "Deploy to Heroku" button and then filling out hte information required by Heroku.

### Hashing Products

We're now hashing products to determine when a product changes that have not been published to the Catalog. This shows up as an indicator on the publish button when viewing a product that has unpublished changes.

### Serve js and css from CDN

We now provide an option to serve the bundled javascript and css files from a CDN. See #4316 for more information.

### robots.txt

We've added a permissive default `robots.txt` file. This file permits all bots to crawl and disallows bots from crawling `/resources`

## Metrics

You don't improve what you don't measure. In efforts to improve the size of our bundles, the time to first paint, time to interactive, and overall performance of our applications, we're starting to report on bundle size and some performance metrics in every release. With effort and persistence, we'll see these numbers improve over time.

### Bundle Size

We measure bundle size by building the application using `meteor build` and then measuring the js and css bundle size with the command `wc -c /path/to/js-bundle-file.js`

**JS Modern Browsers:** 4872kb
**JS Legacy Browsers:** 5104kb
**CSS All Browsers:** 392kb

# v1.13.1

This release exclusively includes a patch update to Meteor from `1.7.0.1` to `1.7.0.3`

This release should be installed by anyone on Reaction 1.13.0 and includes an important security update to Node, updating to version 8.11.3 of Node, which is an important security release.

The underlying meteor-babel npm package has also been updated to version 7.0.0-beta.51.

## Security

- security: Update to Meteor 1.7.0.3 (#4368)

# v1.13.0

## Removal of Legacy Product Revision Control system

The major change in this release is that we've removed the existing revision control system in favor of publishing Products to the Catalog. The existing revision control system contained some powerful ideas, but was complex and intertwined into many areas of the app that were not directly related to Product. By removing the old revision control system, we've paved the way to substantially improve product grid performance, especially for Operators and we've simplified the product publication logic.

This removes all code, hooks, collections, and packages related to revision control.

**Breaking changes:**

- Any custom packages that depend on the `Revision` control system.
- Operators will no longer be able to "undo" changes to a product. Instead products are published through the catalog
- Any _unpublished_ changes to products will be lost when upgrading to `1.13.0`. In this release, it's possible that if you were to downgrade that you would see the unpublished changes again, but that may cause unexpected behavior. We recommend either publishing or discarding any changes to your products before upgrading to this release.
- Similarly, any products that have been created but not published will demonstrate unexpected behavior. To avoid this undesirable behavior, publish any newly created, unpublished products prior to upgrading to this release.

- **All plugin authors** will need to update your `package.json` with a change to the babel config similar to what was done [here](https://github.com/reaction-contrib/meteor-authorize-net/commit/f19a5cf7591a17f426e67bd3737af5a4d1c7a64a)

## Update to Meteor 1.7

This update brings some enormous improvements to the amount of time it takes to rebuild the application in development after making a file change. In some (less than perfectly scientific) tests that I ran testing file changes between 1.7 and 1.6.1 I saw 50%-90% improvements in the reload time. Your experience may vary depending on how much you've customized Reaction, your computer specs, and your specific development setup, but I fully expect this to be a noticeable improvement for anyone working with Reaction.

There are some [early](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/9949) [reports](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/9945) that the included update to the MongoDB driver may have [some kinks](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/9944) to work out, so I'd follow those issues on Meteor's repo if that's a cause for concern for you. These reports are all coming from a single person, and we haven't experienced any of these issues in particular yet, but we'll be keeping an eye on them.

##

We ran into a few issues with `npm install` that we resolved in #4317. One product that came out of this investigation was some documentation for how to properly clean up and rebuild docker images in Reaction.

To stop and clean up your images

```sh
  docker-compose down -v --rmi local --remove-orphans
```

To rebuild your Reaction images

```sh
  docker-compose up --build --force-recreate --renew-anon-volumes
```

If you only want to run Reaction and not the GraphQL DevServer

```sh
  docker-compose up --build --force-recreate --renew-anon-volumes reaction
```

If you only want to run the DevServer and not the Meteor app

```sh
  docker-compose up --build --force-recreate --renew-anon-volumes devserver
```

# v1.12.1

## Bug Fixes

- fix: handle products without positions obj .. Resolves #4299

This release is a hotfix for #4299 which was discovered shortly after v1.12.0 was released.

The issue was releated to a type error that was thrown during a migration:

> If any documents in `Catalog` collection do not have a `positions` property, migration fails on startup on first start after migration to v1.12.0. The migration is left locked. The error message is:

```
0|reaction | TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object
0|reaction |     at Function.keys (<anonymous>)
0|reaction |     at items.forEach (imports/plugins/core/versions/server/migrations/25_update_catalog_schema.js:28:12)
```

# v1.12.0

## Breaking changes

We've made some significant changes to the structure of the data that we publish to the Catalog in #4218. We have created an automated migration for these changes in #4272. If you have made other changes to the catalog in your app or in a plugin, this migration may not work out of the box for you. We'd recommend migrating a test or staging instance of your application with similar data before applying this update to your production application.

From the PR notes to #4218, here's a list of the changes

### Method argument change

"products/updateProductPosition" method now takes a tag ID rather than tag name as its third argument

### Media change

The `media` property on catalog items is still an array of objects, but the structure of those objects has changed.

BEFORE:

```js
{
  metadata: {}, // the full metadata object from the Media doc
  thumbnail: "", // a URL
  small: "", // a URL
  medium: "", // a URL
  large: "", // a URL
  image: "", // a URL
}
```

AFTER:

```js
{
  priority, // copied from metadata
  toGrid, // copied from metadata
  productId, // copied from metadata
  variantId, // copied from metadata
  URLs: {
    thumbnail: "", // a URL
    small: "", // a URL
    medium: "", // a URL
    large: "", // a URL
    original: "", // a URL
  }
}
```

Also, the media array is now sorted in ascending `priority` order.

### Deleted and hidden variants change

When published to the catalog, the `variants` array on the catalog item now includes only those variants where `isDeleted` IS NOT true and `isVisible` IS true.

### Product props separated from catalog item props

Most product properties that were formerly on the catalog item itself are now moved to a `product` object property.

### Explicit property copying

Previously all product and variant props were blindly copied into the catalog item. Now, we explicitly copy only the props we want, sometimes changing their names.

### Property name changes

- `variant.taxable -> variant.isTaxable`
- `variant.variantId` added, currently the same as variant.\_id but might not always be. A reference back to the variant in the Products collection.
- `product.taxable -> product.isTaxable`
- `product.productId` added, currently the same as product.\_id but might not always be. A reference back to the product in the Products collection.
- `product.handle -> product.slug`
- `product.hashtags -> product.tagIds`

`product.twitterMsg` and `product.facebookMsg` and `product.googleplusMsg` and `product.pinterestMsg` are converted to a `product.socialMetadata` array like this:

```js
socialMetadata: [
  { service: "twitter", message: product.twitterMsg },
  { service: "facebook", message: product.facebookMsg },
  { service: "googleplus", message: product.googleplusMsg },
  { service: "pinterest", message: product.pinterestMsg }
];
```

### New Pricing Object

We've deprecated the `price` property on catalog products, variants, and options. There is a new property called `pricing`, which is a map keyed by currency code in MongoDB, and in GraphQL is converted to an array.

The GraphQL schema:

```graphql
"The product price or price range for a specific currency"
type ProductPricingInfo {
  """
  A comparison price value, usually MSRP. If `price` is null, this will also be null. That is,
  only purchasable variants will have a `compareAtPrice`.
  """
  compareAtPrice: Float

  "The code for the currency these pricing details applies to"
  currency: Currency!

  """
  UI should display this price. If a product has multiple potential prices depending on selected
  variants and options, then this is a price range string such as "$3.95 - $6.99". It includes the currency
  symbols.
  """
  displayPrice: String!

  "The price of the most expensive possible variant+option combination"
  maxPrice: Float!

  "The price of the least expensive possible variant+option combination"
  minPrice: Float!

  """
  For variants with no options and for options, this will always be set to a price. For variants
  with options and products, this will be `null`. There must be a price for a variant to be
  added to a cart or purchased. Otherwise you would instead add one of its child options to a cart.
  """
  price: Float
}
```

These are currently mapped as follows, but in the future you will be able to have different prices per currency that your shop supports.

```js
pricing: {
      [shopCurrencyCode]: {
        compareAtPrice: variant.compareAtPrice || null,
        displayPrice: variantPriceInfo.range,
        maxPrice: variantPriceInfo.max,
        minPrice: variantPriceInfo.min,
        price: typeof variant.price === "number" ? variant.price : null
      }
    },
```

### Catalog Item props

All product props other than `positions` are now on the `product` object, so there are a few new properties on the catalog item itself:

- \_id (this is no longer the same as the product ID)
- shopId (stays here AND on `product` obj)
- createdAt
- updatedAt

### ReactionProduct.getTag

The `ReactionProduct.getTag` helper function is renamed to `ReactionProduct.getTagIdForPosition` and returns the tag ID rather than name. If there's no tag in the route path, it returns "\_default" rather than the lowercased shop name.

# v1.11.0

The major focus of `v1.11.0` has been on our GraphQL API. We've added most of the queries and mutations that are necessary for building a headless client to interact with `Accounts`. We're actively doing experiments on how we'll recommend connecting to this GraphQL client and we'll start publishing some of our initial client apps to interact with this GraphQL API in the near future.

# v1.10.0

## Collection Hooks | Breaking Change!

The biggest change in 1.10.0 is the removal of the [meteor-collection-hooks](https://github.com/matb33/meteor-collection-hooks) package. If your app or plugin is dependent on collection hooks, we'd recommend refactoring to eliminate the need for those types of hooks. If you're not up for refactoring you can just add that package back into your app though you'll lose some of the benefits that Reaction will see by eliminating that dependency. The removal of this package is a breaking change for any plugin that depends on collection hooks or uses the `direct` method to update a collection. For example, `Products.before`, `Products.after`, and `Products.direct` will no longer work. These hooks have all been migrated to our event hook system. If you were using Collection hooks to perform an action that you cannot perform in 1.10.0 with the current set of event hooks, please file an issue and we can determine if we need to add additional event hooks. This change should lead to much simpler code that is easier to understand.

## New GraphQL API

In addition to a few performance updates, refactors, and bug fixes, this release starts the rollout of our GraphQL API. Until further notice, this GraphQL API should be considered a prototype and should not be used for production. If you're interested in following along with our GraphQL work, tracking our [GraphQL issues](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+graphql+) is probably the easiest way for now.

In short, this release adds a prototype GraphQL server running in the Reaction project with the following urls exposed:

```
/graphql - The GraphQL endpoint.
/graphiql - The GraphiQL user interface.
```

We'll be incrementally adding functionality to this GraphQL endpoint, but this release serves as the starting point for our GraphQL api.

This release contains a lot of fixes, some of them performance related and several enormous refactors.
The three biggest changes are:

1. We've migrated from the Meteor version of Simple Schema to the npm version. See notes in the breaking changes section below.
2. We've dropped our dependency on the deprecated Meteor-CollectionFS package. We've replaced it with an npm package we've created called [reaction-file-collections](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-file-collections)
3. We've created a new catalog collection for use on the Product Grid when viewed by a consumer or other user without a product admin role

There's a full list of changes and fixes below, as well as detailed explanations of potential breaking changes and what you might need to do to migrate

## BREAKING CHANGES

This is a breaking change for any plugin that implements or modifies a schema based on the Meteor simple-schema package.

### From the Simple Schema update

This PR updates the `aldeed:simple-schema` Meteor package dependency to instead depend on the `simpl-schema` NPM package, which is the newest release of the same library. As part of this change, there are several breaking changes and other gotchas to be aware of.

IMPORTANT! The NPM package does not play nice with the previous Meteor package. After updating to this Reaction release, run the app one time, and then look at the .meteor/versions file. Make sure that aldeed:simple-schema is not listed. If it is there, that is because you depend on another Meteor package that depends on aldeed:simple-schema. You will have to update or remove any such packages (with meteor remove / meteor add) until aldeed:simple-schema disappears from your .meteor/versions file.
Search your app for any import { SimpleSchema } from "meteor/aldeed:simple-schema" lines that you have added in your custom code, and replace them with import SimpleSchema from "simpl-schema"
Be aware that the package name does not have the "e" on "simpl". (There is a different NPM package called simple-schema with the "e", and that is NOT the one you want.)
If you have your own custom schemas, refer to the SimpleSchema changelog to update them for the breaking changes: https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-simple-schema/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#200
If you use attachSchema in your code, be aware that passing an array to attachSchema will no longer work. You should first merge all the schemas and then pass the combined schema to attachSchema

Please read the PR if you need more details [Use NPM SimpleSchema rather than Meteor #3331](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/3331)

### From the removal of CollecitonFS

#### If you've saved the file URLs anywhere, they're now different.

```
/assets/files/:collectionName/:fileId/:filename
```

becomes

```
/assets/files/:collectionName/:fileId/:primaryStoreName/:filename
```

and

```
/assets/files/:collectionName/:fileId/:filename?store=storeName
```

becomes

```
/assets/files/:collectionName/:fileId/:storeName/:filename
```

#### We've deleted some unused Blaze templates rather than update URL handling within them:

- shopBrandImageOption
- ordersListItems
- select
- upload
- productMetaField
- productMetaFieldForm
- metaComponent
- productDetailEdit
- productDetailField
- productImageGallery
- imageDetail
- imageUploader
- productSocial
- variantList
- variant
- Media-related publishing is changed and improved:

#### Publications have been added, removed, or changed:

- `CartItemImage` publication is removed
- `CartImages` now takes an ID
- Added `ProductGridMedia` to replace Media being included with the products publication for the grid
- Added `ProductMedia`
- Added `OrderImages`, similar to `CartImages`, used for order now rather than reusing CartImages

Full notes on the PR to replace CFS #3782

### From the customer product catalog

The old `imports/plugins/included/product-variants/containers/productsContainer.js` has been renamed to `productsContainerAdmin.js` and a new component named `productsContainer.js` now handles which products container to load based on the user's permissions. Full notes on the PR #3876

### From the Dockerfile updates

reactioncommerce/base:v4.0.1 removed the following:

- Removed the conditional MongoDB installation (via \$INSTALL_MONGO env). Use `mongo` as a service in docker-compose, see example in README.
- Removed the conditional PhantomJS installation (via \$INSTALL_PHANTOMJS env). If PhantomJS is required in your build, you can include it in your custom Dockerfile.
  Full notes on the PR

## Dockerfile Updates

- Base image updated to `reactioncommerce/base:v4.0.1` which has:
  - `node:8.9.4` as base image (same Debian base as before, but with Node 8 preinstalled)
  - Meteor 1.6.1 preinstalled
- [Multi-stage build support](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/).
  This helped reduce the size of the production image by removing un-required dependencies.
- Final production bundle uses `node:8.9.4-slim`

## Docker Compose changes

- Updated existing `docker-compose.yml` to serve as the config for running a local development environment.
- Added a new `docker-compose-demo.yml` for testing out production builds (this is the replacement for the previous `docker-compose.yml`).

## Upgrades

- Use NPM SimpleSchema rather than Meteor (#3331)

## CI

We've updated our circle ci config to use [v2 of Workflows](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/). This permits us to run additional automated tests on circle instead of using other services. We now have 6 workflow steps that must pass before a PR can be merged.

# v1.8.0

## Meteor 1.6.1

This release upgrades Reaction to Meteor 1.6.1

This is a possible BREAKING CHANGE. We've done our best to keep core reaction backwards compatible with this release, but as this update includes bumping to Babel 7, if you have plugins that depend on Babel 6, they will break.
The [Meteor 1.6.1 announcement](https://blog.meteor.com/announcing-meteor-1-6-1-50aad71da4e6) or [release notes](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/master/History.md#v161-2018-01-19) are the best places to go for help debugging problems specific to Meteor introduced by this release. Additionally, you may want to check out Babel's own guide on [Upgrading to Babel 7](https://babeljs.io/blog/2017/03/01/upgrade-to-babel-7) or [Planning for Babel 7](https://babeljs.io/blog/2017/09/12/planning-for-7.0)

**The biggest change in this release is that we're upgrading to Babel 7.**

```
"@babel/runtime": "7.0.0-beta.38",
```

and in our `dev-dependencies`

```
"@babel/cli": "7.0.0-beta.38",
"@babel/core": "7.0.0-beta.38",
"@babel/preset-react": "7.0.0-beta.38",
"babel-preset-meteor": "7.0.0-beta.38-1"

```

Our babel presets now looks like this:

```
"presets": []
```

Yes, we've removed `stage-2` and `env` from our presets. That's recommended as meteor now includes `babel-preset-meteor`

Please see the PR #3615 for even more detail on what has changed in the update to Meteor 1.6.1

## ESLint

This release introduces the following changes to our .eslintrc file

#### jsx-a11y

We've added the recommended set of rules for [jsx-a11y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y).
Reaction has always maintained a commitment to accessibility and adding this rule set provides linting rules to help enforce Aria and a11y compliance.

```
"extends": [
  "plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended"
],
```

#### Base rule set

We've added the following base eslint rules. You can find their descriptions and examples of failing and passing code here: https://eslint.org/docs/rules/

```

## Collection Hooks

We've removed the Collection Hooks package. This may be a breaking change if you're relying on Collection Hooks in your plugins. You can follow our examples to remove the Collection Hooks dependencies from your plugins or (not recommended) you can install the collection hooks meteor package back into your application without error.

#### We've replaced Accounts and Revisions Collection Hooks in #3642

- Replaced all Account & Revision .before, .after collection hooks to use Hooks.Events API.
- Updated Revisons.after.update(callback) to be Hooks.Events.add("afterRevisionUpdate", callback) and added Hooks.Events.run("afterRevisionUpdate", userId, revision) after every Revisons.update(...) call.
- Updated Accounts.after.insert(callback) to be Hooks.Events.add("afterAccountsInsert", callback) and added a Hooks.Events.run("afterAccountsInsert", userId, user) after every Accounts.insert(...) call.
- Updated Accounts.after.remove(callback) to be Hooks.Events.add("afterAccountsRemove", callback) and added a Hooks.Events.run("afterAccountsRemove", userId, user) after every
  Accounts.remove(...) call.
- Updated Accounts.after.update(callback) to be Hooks.Events.add("afterAccountsUpdate", callback) and added a Hooks.Events.run("afterAccountsUpdate", userId, user) after every Accounts.update(...) call.
- Removed .direct from any Accounts or Revisions collection calls

## Breaking Changes

There are potentially breaking changes you should be aware of in this release.

- (breaking, feat) CoreLayout should probe for React component as fallback (#3524) .. Resolves #3523
  A plugin which has named React components identically to Blaze templates in core may no longer work.
- (breaking, refactor) Remove unnecessary code in Media subscription. (#3558) .. Resolves #3548
  We've renamed the `Media` subscription located in `client/modules/core/subscriptions.js`. This subscription's content has not changed, but is now more aptly named `BrandAssets`. This will only cause problems if you were subscribing to the `Media` publication seprately in your plugin.
- (fix): remove "admin" permission from shop manager role (#3505) .. Resolves #3541
  We've removed the `admin` role from the default role set that is granted to the Shop Manager group. This should not affect any existing shops, but if you have plugins or users that rely on the `admin` role being granted to the Shop Manager group you may need to update your plugins.
- (refactor): replace imagemagick with sharp (#3631) .. Resolves #3482
  This is only a breaking change if you have a plugin that depends on `gm`. It should be trivial to replace with `sharp` and this PR serves as an example of how to do so.
  Replace GraphicMagick/ImageMagick with sharp and remove dependency on `gm`
  Add sharp to the project and dynamically loads where necessary
  Update image transforms to to use the sharp() functions.
  Refactor the "Media" FS.Collection to map the image transforms through a buildGFS() function to create each FS.Store.GridFS collection.
- (refactor): dynamically import moment.js (#3602) .. Resolves #2635
  Provides `withMoment` HOC to wrap components that use moment.
  May cause breaking changes if you relied on any of the following Blaze templates or helpers which are no longer used in core:
  Remove `timezoneOptions` Blaze template helper from `client/modules/core/helpers/templates.js`, as it's no longer used in any core files.
  Remove `ordersList`, `orderPage/details` and `orderPage` Blaze templates, which were replaced by React templates
  Move `dateFormat` Blaze template helper out of the global helpers, and into a specific template helper, since it's only used in one place
- Babel 7 / Meteor 1.6.1 update mentioned in detail at the beginning of these release notes.
